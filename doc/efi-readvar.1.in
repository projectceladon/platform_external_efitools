efi-readvar - tool for showing secure variables

[description]

with no arguments, prints out the entire secure variable database and
expands the contents of hashes and X509 certificates.  May be
restricted to specific variables and specific signatures within
variables.  Note that EFI signature lists are numbered from zero and
may contain one or more entries (also numbered from zero), so 0-0
represents the first entry of signature list zero.

[examples]

To see all the variables, type

efi-readvars

To see the second entry of signature list 1 for the db variable, do

efi-readvars -v db -s 1-1

To see all entries of signature list 0 for the KEK

efi-readvars -v KEK -s 0
