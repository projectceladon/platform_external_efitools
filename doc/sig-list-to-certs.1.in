[name]
sig-list-to-certs - tool for converting EFI signature lists
back to openssl certificates

[description]

Takes <efi sig list file> and converts it to a set of DER
format openssl certificates in <cert file base name>.n
(where n runs from 0 to the number of certificates in the
file)

[examples]

To see what certificates your UEFI system currently has, you
can run the dmpstore command to print them to a file

dmpstore PK > PK.uc16

This file isn't readily readable on a standard unix system
because it's in UC-16 format, so convert it to ordinary text

iconv -f utf-16 PK.uc16 > PK.txt

Now remove the header which says something like

 Dump Variable pk
 Variable NV+RT+BS 'Efi:PK' DataSize = 2DA

Leaving only the hex dump.  This can then be converted to an
EFI signature list by xxd

xxd -r PK.txt > PK.esl

and you can now extract openssl readable certificates from
this

sig-list-to-certs PK.esl PK

Which will print some information like

 X509 Header sls=730, header=0, sig=686
 file PK.0: Guid 77fa9abd-0359-4d32-4d60-28f4e78f784b
 Written 686 bytes

And finally, you can see the certificate in text format

openssl x509 -text -inform DER -in PK.0

Assuming it's an X509 certificate
